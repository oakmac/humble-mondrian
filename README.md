# Mondrian Painting in HumbleUI

As a challenge for my coding bootcamp students when teaching them CSS, I would
ask them to build this [Piet Mondrian painting] using flexbox.

As an exercise for myself (and to test out the layout system), I did the same
using [HumbleUI].

This project originally adapted from [humble-deck].
